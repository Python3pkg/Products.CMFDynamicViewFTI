CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.5 - Unreleased

    - Fix tests to pass if Five/Zope3 is installed.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.4 - Released March 19, 2006

    - Made 'safe_callable' truly safe by using 'safe_hasattr'.
    - Made tests use CMFTestCase. There is no Plone dependency whatsoever.
    - Fixed a bug in getViewMethod. A present, but empty 'layout' attribute
      now also returns the default view instead of ''. Returning the empty
      string sends PortalContent.__call__() into a loop.

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.3 - Released February 25, 2006

    - Added conditional import for typeClasses to make the code CMF1.6
      compatible while staying CMF1.5 backwards compatible.
      [hannosch]

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.2 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Change getViewMethod's 'enforce_available' argument to default to False
      instead of True. If someone goes to the trouble of either using python
      or adding a property to indicate a specific template as the default
      layout, we should let them.

CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.1 - Released August 9, 2005

    - Improved Plone 2.1 integration: getDefaultPage. Replace try/except with a
      better checking for Plone. Bonus: whitespaces cleanup.
      [deo]

    - Stop acquisation for default_page.
